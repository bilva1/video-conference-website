Set up the project:
Create a new folder for your project and initialize a new Node.js project using npm (Node Package Manager). Install the required packages like express, socket.io, and any other dependencies.

Front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
Create an HTML file for the video conferencing interface. Use CSS for styling the layout and design. Use JavaScript to handle user interactions and set up the WebRTC connection.

Establishing the WebRTC connection:
In your JavaScript code, use the WebRTC API to establish a connection between users. This involves getting access to the user's camera and microphone, creating a new RTCPeerConnection, and exchanging signaling messages through your server using socket.io.

Textual Chatting:
Implement a textual chat feature using socket.io. When a user sends a message, emit a socket.io event to the server, which then broadcasts the message to all connected users.

Audio-Video Interactions:
Set up the WebRTC connection to enable audio and video communication between users. When a user joins a video conference, send the necessary signaling information to the other participants to establish a peer-to-peer connection.

Video Recording:
To enable video recording, you can use the MediaRecorder API in combination with the getUserMedia API. When the conference starts, begin recording the audio and video streams from each participant using MediaRecorder
